## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your preferred AI agent in the repo root.
3. Type `init` to start the intake flow.
4. Answer the Phase 1 (Core) mandatory intake questions about project name, purpose, tech stack, and architecture.
5. If prompted, continue with Phase 2 (type-specific) follow-ups that match your app type, and optionally skip Phase 3 (advanced) questions.
6. Review the generated spec files under `sdd/memory-bank/`.
7. Reply `approved` when you are happy with the specs so the agent can start coding in `app/`.
