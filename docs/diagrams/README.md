# Diagrams

Workflow diagrams are stored as:
- `.excalidraw`: editable source files (open in Excalidraw)
- `.svg`: Excalidraw-exported snapshots embedded in `README.md` for GitHub rendering

If you edit a diagram, update the corresponding `.svg` snapshot so the README stays accurate.

Recommended workflow:
1. Edit the `.excalidraw` file in Excalidraw.
2. Export as SVG (white background).
3. Replace the matching `.svg` file in this folder.
