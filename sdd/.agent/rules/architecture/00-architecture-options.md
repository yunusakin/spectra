# Architecture Options

- Layered: simple CRUD or small services.
- Hexagonal: complex domains, clear boundaries, testability.
- CQRS: write/read separation, heavy read models.
- Microservices: multiple teams, independent deployment.
- Event-driven: async workflows and integrations.

Choose the simplest architecture that meets requirements.
