# Approval Gate

- After intake, write spec files under `sdd/memory-bank/`.
- Stop and ask for explicit approval (reply "approved").
- Do not generate any application code before approval.
- When approved, generate code only under `app/`.
- After approval, say "I will create sprint plan" and populate `sdd/memory-bank/core/sprint-plan.md` and `sdd/memory-bank/core/sprint-current.md`.
