# Approval Gate

- After intake, write spec files under `sdd/memory-bank/`.
- Stop and ask for explicit approval (reply "approved").
- Do not generate any application code before approval.
- When approved:
  1. Create the `app/` directory if it doesn't exist.
  2. Generate code only under `app/`.
  3. Say "I will create sprint plan" and populate `sdd/memory-bank/core/sprint-plan.md` and `sdd/memory-bank/core/sprint-current.md`.
