# Refactor to Project Patterns

## Goal
Refactor the selected code to align with the project's documented architecture and patterns.

## Steps
1. Identify the current structure and deviations.
2. Map to target patterns in `sdd/.agent/rules/architecture/00-architecture-options.md`.
3. Apply refactor in `app/` only.
4. Update specs if architecture decisions change (`sdd/memory-bank/arch/decisions.md`).
5. Ensure tests are updated or added.

## Output
- A concise summary of changes and affected files.
- Any required updates to `sdd/memory-bank/` files.
