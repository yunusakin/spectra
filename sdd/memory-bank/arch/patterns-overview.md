# Architecture Patterns

> Filled by intake. Include only sections with answers.

<!--
Example:

## Chosen Style
- Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

## High-Level Structure
- Domain layer (entities, domain services)
- Application layer (use cases)
- Infrastructure layer (DB, messaging, HTTP)

## Notes
- Keep frameworks at the edges; domain stays framework-agnostic.
