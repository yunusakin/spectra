# Gateway Stack

> Optional. Use when gateway or BFF tech needs detailed tracking.

<!--
Example:

## API Gateway / BFF
- Technology: NGINX or API Gateway product
- Responsibilities: routing, authN/Z, rate limiting

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Centralized logging of requests/responses (without PII).
- Global error envelope mapping (e.g., RFC7807).
