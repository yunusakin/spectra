# Frontend-BFF Integration

> Optional. Use when frontend-to-backend gateway integration needs detailed tracking.

<!--
Example:

## Contracts
- REST over HTTPS
- Response errors follow RFC7807

## Auth
- Frontend uses OIDC login
- BFF forwards user identity via session/JWT

## Cross-Origin / Cookies
- Same-site cookies in prod
- CORS enabled for local dev only

## Performance
- Cache GETs for 30s where safe
- Use request coalescing for fan-out calls
