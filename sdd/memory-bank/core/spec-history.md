# Spec History

> Optional but recommended. Track major spec changes and re-approvals over time.

<!--
Example:

| Version | Date       | Summary                                   | Files Changed (high level)                | Approved |
|--------:|------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| v1      | 2026-02-06 | Initial intake completed                  | projectbrief, stack, patterns, reqs      | yes      |
| v2      | 2026-02-10 | Switch REST to gRPC for internal services | stack, requirements, api notes, decisions| yes      |
| v2.1    | 2026-02-12 | Clarify NFRs (no behavior change)         | requirements, constraints                 | no       |

Guidance:
- Add a row for every (re-)approval and for major spec changes.
- If a change requires re-approval, set Approved = yes only after the user replies `approved`.
