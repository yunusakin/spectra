# Active Context

> Auto-maintained by the agent. Read this first when resuming work.

## Current Focus
<!-- What the agent is currently working on. One sentence. -->

## Recent Changes
<!-- Last 5 files changed and why. Update after each task. -->
<!--
Example:
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/src/orders/create.ts` | Implemented order creation endpoint |
| `sdd/memory-bank/core/traceability.md` | Mapped order creation to spec |
-->

## Open Decisions
<!-- Unresolved questions that need user input before proceeding. -->

## Session Boundary
<!-- When switching agents or resuming after a break, summarize what was in progress. -->
<!--
Example:
Last session ended mid-implementation of the payment integration.
Next step: finish the Stripe webhook handler in `app/src/payments/webhook.ts`.
Blocked on: user decision about idempotency key strategy (see Open Decisions).
