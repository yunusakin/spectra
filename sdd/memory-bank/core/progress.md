# Progress

## Done
- Replaced Mermaid workflow diagrams with Excalidraw sources and committed SVG snapshots for README rendering.
- Implemented SDDLite: Consolidated product context, requirements, and constraints into `sdd/memory-bank/core/projectbrief.md` (retired separate files).
- Updated intake rules and memory bank index to reflect the new structure.
- Added mandatory automated progress tracking rule to `00-spec-lifecycle.md`.
- Updated `docs/examples/backend-api-orders-service.md` to reference consolidated `projectbrief.md` instead of deleted files.
- Verified repository integrity; no stale references to deleted spec files found.

## In Progress
- Final validation of the consolidated spec logic.
