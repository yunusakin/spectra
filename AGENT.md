# Agent Entry (Generic)

All canonical rules live in `sdd/.agent/`.

Read and follow:
- `sdd/.agent/README.md`
- `sdd/.agent/rules/index.md`

Key rules (summary):
- Type `init` to start the intake flow.
- Do not write application code before explicit approval.
- All application code must be generated under `app/` only.
- Specs and decisions live under `sdd/memory-bank/`.
- After intake, auto-fill spec files with collected answers.
