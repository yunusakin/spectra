All canonical rules live in `sdd/.agent/`.

Read and follow:
- `sdd/.agent/README.md`
- `sdd/.agent/rules/index.md`

Init trigger: when the user message is exactly `init`, start the intake flow.

All application code must live under `app/`.
Create the `app/` directory if it doesn't exist when approval is received.
